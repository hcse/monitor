# Purpose
Smart contract to manage metrics and events. 

This metrics functionality is designed to record on-chain metrics to be used with prometheus and grafana.

The events functionality is designed to create a 'feed' of relevant events for dapp participants, which can be much more tailored than a typical block explorer transaction history.
